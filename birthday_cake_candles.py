#You are in-charge of the cake for your niece's birthday and have decided the
#cake will have one candle for each year of her total age. When she blows out
#the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones. Your task is to
#find out how many candles she can successfully blow out.

#For example, if your niece is turning 4 years old, and the cake will have 4
#candles of height 3, 2, 1, 3, she will be able to blow out 2 candles successfully,
#since the tallest candle is of height 3 and there are 2 such candles.
